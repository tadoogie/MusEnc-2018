# Music Curation and Analytics 2018

The theme of my dataset will be the works by artist Adele. I feel I will be able to acquire descriptive, acoustic and notated data easily.

Descriptive Data
	Spotify, iTunes, Deezer
		Track name, Artist, BPM, Composers, producers, publisher, track length, album track listing, album artworks
		The data is very structured on these sources and described clearly for the audience to access. 
		Algorithms used to analyse things such as popularity, related songs, listener preferences.

Acoustic Data
	Studio Recordings / Live Performance Recordings
		Technology used to convert live audio into audio recordings
		Analysed through waveforms etc
		
Notated Data
	Sheet Music available on places such as MuseScore, GuitarTabs, SheetsDaily etc.
	Displayed in the form of image files and MusicXML
