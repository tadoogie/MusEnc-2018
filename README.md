# Music Curation and Analytics 2018

The theme of my dataset will be the works by artist Adele. I feel I will be able to acquire descriptive, acoustic and notated data easily.

Descriptive Data
	Spotify, iTunes, Deezer
		Track name, Artist, BPM, Composers, producers, publisher, track length, album track listing, album artworks
		Very structured data easily shown
		Algorithms used to analyse things such as popularity, related songs, listener preferences.

Acoustic Data
	Studio Recordings / Live Performance Recordings

Notated Data
